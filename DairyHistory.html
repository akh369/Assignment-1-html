<td><p >  In the year 1805, two farmers, Frimelda Legion and Alphonse Legion from the north of France envisioned a dream. After losing thier only child due to milk poisioning,they envision a future where parent would not need to worry ever again 
about the cleaniness or quality of a bottle of milk. This was during the time where plagues affecting cows and humans were a common sight. This has caused some folks to be wary of drinking anything dairy related from fear of 
getting sick. In a time where medicine was commodity only afforable to the richest of folks, this have caused dairy farms to become bankrupt and close down. This indirectly cause a defiect of essential nutrition among the younger children.
Among all this chaos, Frimelda and Alphonse was not to be detered. They have been part of the dairy community ever since birth, and shall not abandone thier dairy heritage because of a few unfortuntate events.</table>

<td><p >  Yet, from despair came hope. The death of thier only child did not bring them grief, yet further revealed to them how important dairy truly is. As such, with a renewed fervour, They continued to operate thier diary farm. They wish to redefine the dairy industry. They found out that the frequent diesease related to cattle was not natural. It was, infact brought about by poor hygine and rushed production. By the 1800s, the population has
started to fluctuate, causing dairy farmers all over to forgo customs and rushed the production of milk. The Legion's sought to overcome this  problem. A dairy farm capable of both producing high quality milk as well as meet the demands of its 
ever growing customers. That was what they envisioned, and it was what they accomplished. By the year 1833, Legion Dairy farm was household name in whole of France, and was said to producing 69% of all of France's milk.

<td><p > In the year 1869, after the death of the Legions due to an unforunate accident, a billionaire named Aakash Suppiah managed to accquire the rights to Legion Dairy Farm. Thanks to him and his descendents, they managed to not only stay true to the ways of Frimelda and Alphonse, they also improved in every way possible and make Legion Dairy a world famous product. Today, Legion Dairy Farm can be found around the globe in over 39 different
countries, yet no matter the region, one can expect the same quality and freshness with ever bottle of Legion Dairy milk and any of it other dairy product. We use a blend and modern and traditional ways to create our world famous dairy product, as well as to keep true to the ways Alphonse and Frimelda envisioned for their company.</table>
